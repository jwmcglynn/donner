Donner is an under-development modern C++20 SVG rendering library which provides full access to the SVG DOM, enabling browser-level functionality without the browser.

Currently, Donner includes:

- SVG2 core functionality, such as shapes, fills, strokes, and gradients.
- CSS3 parsing and cascading support, with a hand-rolled library.
- An [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) ECS-backed document tree.
- A SVG DOM-style API to traverse, inspect, and modify documents in memory.
- A two-phase renderer, which builds and caches a rendering tree for efficient frame-based rendering.

Donner renders with Skia, which provides the same high-quality rendering used by Chromium.

Donner focuses on security and performance, which is validated with code coverage and fuzz testing.
