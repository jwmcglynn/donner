Donner is a modern C++20 SVG rendering library, written as a hobby project which intends to provide an easily embeddable SVG support into apps and games, enabling browser-level functionality without the browser.

Currently, Donner includes:
- SVG2 core functionality, such as shapes, fills, strokes, and gradients.
- CSS3 parsing and cascading support, with a hand-rolled library.
- An [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) ECS-backed document tree.
- A SVG DOM-style API to traverse, inspect, and modify documents in memory.
- A two-phase renderer, which builds and caches a rendering tree for efficient frame-based rendering.

Donner currently renders with Skia as core functionality is being implemented.  While Skia is powerful, it adds a lot of code size so alternative approaches may be considered in the future.

Donner focuses on security and performance, which is validated with code coverage and fuzz testing.

## Project Goals

- Have minimal dependencies, so it can be integrated into existing applications, assuming a modern compiler.
- Expose the SVG DOM, so that applications can manipulate SVGs dynamically.
- Implement the [SVG 2 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/).

## Other Libraries

- **[librsvg](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg)**: Provides a simple way to render SVGs one-shot, does not provide a DOM or animation
- **[resvg](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg)**: A Rust library that focuses on correctness, safety, and portability for static SVGs
