---------------------

### 1. Terms

By accessing the website at <https://hdoc.io>, you are agreeing to be
bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations,
and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable
local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are
prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in
this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

### 2. Use License

1.  Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the
    materials (information or software) on hdoc's website for personal,
    non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a
    license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may
    not:
    - modify or copy the materials;
    - use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public
      display (commercial or non-commercial);
    - attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained
      on hdoc's website;
    - remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the
      materials; or
    - transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the
      materials on any other server.
2.  This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of
    these restrictions and may be terminated by hdoc at any time. Upon
    terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination
    of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your
    possession whether in electronic or printed format.

### 3. Disclaimer

1.  The materials on hdoc's website are provided on an 'as is' basis.
    hdoc makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims
    and negates all other warranties including, without limitation,
    implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or
    other violation of rights.
2.  Further, hdoc does not warrant or make any representations
    concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use
    of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such
    materials or on any sites linked to this site.

### 4. Limitations

In no event shall hdoc or its suppliers be liable for any damages
(including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or
due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use
the materials on hdoc's website, even if hdoc or a hdoc authorized
representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility
of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on
implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

### 5. Accuracy of materials

The materials appearing on hdoc's website could include technical,
typographical, or photographic errors. hdoc does not warrant that any of
the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. hdoc may
make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time
without notice. However hdoc does not make any commitment to update the
materials.

### 6. Links

hdoc has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not
responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of
any link does not imply endorsement by hdoc of the site. Use of any such
linked website is at the user's own risk.

### 7. Modifications

hdoc may revise these terms of service for its website at any time
without notice. By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by
the then current version of these terms of service.

### 8. Governing Law

These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable
therein. Any and all disputes arising under this Agency Agreement,
whether as to interpretation, performance or otherwise, shall be subject
to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of
