"""Classify why a `bazel coverage` run produced no coverage report.

`tools/coverage.sh` fails closed when the report is missing, because a silently
empty report would report full coverage of nothing. That guard is right for the
usual causes (a build error, a crashed test, a cancelled run), but it also fires
on a legitimate case: every selected target is `target_compatible_with` a
platform this lane does not run on, so Bazel skips them all and there is nothing
to measure. A pull request that only touches such a target hits this on every
run and can never go green.

This module reads the build event protocol stream and separates those cases, so
the shell script keeps failing closed except when the stream positively shows
that skipping accounted for every target.

Reads a BEP JSON-lines file; writes one JSON document to stdout:

    {"status": "all_skipped", "skipped": ["//pkg:target"], "produced": []}

`status` is one of:

  all_skipped  At least one target was skipped for incompatibility and NO
               target produced a result. Nothing was measurable here.
  has_results  At least one target produced a result, so a missing report is a
               real failure.
  unknown      The stream is absent, empty, or unparseable. Callers must treat
               this as a failure: absence of evidence is not evidence that
               skipping happened.
